"""

Processing Steps:

1. Compute recorded intime and outimes for each ED admission.
2. Select admissions with ED as the first admission.
3. Remove admissions admitted to special wards, including Partum and Psychiatry. Compute next transfer information.
4. Add patient core information.
5. Remove admissions without triage information.


Other notes.
ROW SUBSETTING COULD BE IMPROVED SOMEHOW
